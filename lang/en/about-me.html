    <h>Who am ?</h1>
    <p>I started programming at the age of 9 at a Unity video game bootcamp. Since then, I've created modded servers and hacked games. Then I went to a private science and technology school. After obtaining my DES, I didn't like CEGEP, so I decided to attend the prestigious '42' programming bootcamp for a month. I then obtained an AEC certification in networking at a private school.</p>
  </div>
    <div class="content-box">
    <h1>Why was I hacking video games?</h1>    
    <p>I was always looking for adrenaline and that's how I used to get it. I was a reputable member of cheating communitites when I was young. Though, I retain is all the knowledge I've gained. I do not promotote nor encourange anybody to do anything illegal, this highlights my knowledge in the numerical world.</p>

    <h1>What is 42?</h1>
    <p>42 is a unique programming school founded by Xavier Niel. It offers a tuition-free computer science education with no traditional teachers or lectures. The curriculum is based on project-based learning and a peer-to-peer method, where students learn by collaborating with one another. The program is intensive and does not require any prior degrees. 42 stands out for its innovative approach and its ability to train skilled, adaptable developers ready to tackle modern technological challenges.</p>

  <div class="content-box">
    <h1>What is my certification?</h1>
    <p>I hold an AEC in Computer Science with a specialization in Networking from Collège O'Sullivan in Québec City. I'm bilingual in French and English, and I've been passionate about computer technologies since childhood. Throughout my training, I've consistently excelled academically. I'm eager to apply my skills in a dynamic company and contribute to innovative projects.</p>
